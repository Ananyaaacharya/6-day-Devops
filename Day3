 1. Auto Scaling (EC2 Auto Scaling)
Purpose: Automatically increases or decreases EC2 instances based on demand.

Steps:

Launch EC2 instance → Create AMI.

Create Launch Template (with AMI and instance type).

Go to Auto Scaling Groups → Create Group.

Set min, max, desired number of instances.

Add scaling policies (e.g., CPU > 70% → add instance).

Attach to Load Balancer (optional).

Use Case: Saves cost & handles traffic efficiently.

 2. MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)
Purpose: Adds an extra layer of security (password + OTP).

Steps:

Go to IAM → Users.

Select a user → Security credentials tab.

Click "Assign MFA device".

Choose Virtual MFA device (use apps like Google Authenticator).

Scan QR code → Enter 2 consecutive OTPs → Done.

Use Case: Prevents unauthorized account access.
