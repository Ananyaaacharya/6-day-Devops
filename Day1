os-interface between user and hardware

cloud computing - on demand delivery of IT resources over the internet. You can access technical resources such as storage, databases, compute, networking, security with pay as you go

cloud providers- aws, microsoft azure, gcp-google cloud platform

SDLC- software development life cycle. Its a structured step by step process that development teams use to create high quality, cost effective and secure software

server components: os(Linux/windows/mac), Ram(6/8/12/16...), Rom(HDD/SDD), networking

all commands -small letter
ls- to list files and directories(folders)

touch- command to create empty files
ex: touch > Ananya
ex: touch Ananya( to display the content)

rm-to remove files
ex: rm Ananya

mkdir: command to create empty directory
ex:mkdir sinchana

cd:change directory
ex: cd directoryname
cd ..(exit from directory) or cd ../..(exits from 2 directories)

rmdir:to delete empty directory
ex: rm directoryname

rm -r:to delete directory with files

ls -l: list the file and directories with permissions

pwd: print working directory/present

history:

devops- set of practices, principles and cultural philosophies that aim to bridge the gap between software development and operations. 
goal- to shorten the sdlc, improve collaboration between development and operations team and deliver high quality software faster and more efficiently 
key elements-1)Automation 2)CI-continuous integration 3)CD-continuous delivery or deployment 5)Collaboration and communication 6)monitoring

waterfall model :
has distinct goals for each phase of development
requirements->analysis->design->coding->testing->operations
limitation
once application is in the testing stage it is very difficult to go back and change something that is not well-thought out in the concept stage

agile methodology:
DevOps is a culture fostering collaboration amongst all participants involved in the development and maintenance of the software. Agile can be described as a development methodology designed to maintain productivity and drive releases with all common reality of changing needs.
limitations:
development team: code works fine in my laptop
operations team: there is some problem with the code it doesn't work in production

its a software development and operations approach that enables faster development of new products and easier maintenance of existing deployments

benefits: speed, rapid delivery, reliability, improved collaboration, scale security

server: it is powerful computer or system that provides services or data to other computers known as clients over the internet.
it is designed to manage, store and process data and they play critical role in handling request delivering responses within a network.
Types of servers:
1.Web server -delivers web pages to users browsers ex:nginx
2.File server-stores and manages files that clients can access and share over a network
3.Database server-manage database and provide access to clients for reading,writing and updating data. ex:mysql, mongodb
4.Mail server-handles the sending, receiving and storage of email. Ex: Microsoft exchange

clients--->internet---->server

Server components: os, ram, rom, cpu, storage, nic

Ec2 configuration:
1.name of the server
2.Application and os images(Amazon machine image)
	-os selection
3.Instance type: choose number of CPU's and RAM
4.Keypair:used to connect securely to instance
5.Networking:
	-firewalls
	-VPC: virtual private cloud
	-subnets
	-route tables
	-NAT
	-Internet gateway
	-Elastic IPS
6.Configure storage
	-EBS(elastic block store)
	-EBS nothing but similar to hard disk
	-Persistent block level storage
	-can create new volumes and attach to running instance
7.Launch instance: Web server/Windows server
